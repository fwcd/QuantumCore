# QuantumCore
A quantum computing library for Java.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fwcd/QuantumCore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fwcd/QuantumCore)

The library is modeled after the paper ["Emulating Circuit-Based and Measurement-Based Quantum Computation"](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/teaching/distinguished-projects/2010/s.allcock.pdf).
